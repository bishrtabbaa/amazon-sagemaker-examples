## :health_worker: Heart Failure Machine Learning Model Motivation

Improved data and analytical models can assist healthcare providers in identifying patients who are at-risk from heart failure, thus allowing providers to proactively recommend and implement a comprehensive protocol consisting of lifestyle changes, pharmaceutical drugs, and advanced interventions if necessary.  Therefore, data analytics and machine learning can play a part in the overall healthcare solution that saves lives from heart failure and other CardioVascular Diseases (CVD) and improves the quality and longevity of life.  This example project follows the [CRISP-DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining) methodology in which the data analytics lifecycle consists of iterative steps:

- Business understanding
- Data understanding
- Data preparation
- Modeling
- Evaluation
- Deployment

## :heart: Heart Failure Domain Understanding

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death globally, taking approximately 17 million lives each year. CVDs are a group of diseases of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.

The most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. The effects of behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and obesity. These “intermediate risks factors” can be measured in primary care facilities and indicate an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and other complications.

Cessation of tobacco use, reduction of salt in the diet, eating more fruit and vegetables, regular physical activity and avoiding harmful use of alcohol have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Health policies that create conducive environments for making healthy choices affordable and available are essential for motivating people to adopt and sustain healthy behaviours.

Identifying those at highest risk of CVDs and ensuring they receive appropriate treatment can prevent premature deaths. Access to noncommunicable disease medicines and basic health technologies in all primary health care facilities is essential to ensure that those in need receive treatment and counselling.

## :floppy_disk: Heart Failure Data Understanding

The data set used in this example project was sourced from the University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository.  The data consists of 299 anonymized patient records with thirteen (13) features that were collected from patients at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad during April-December 2015:

- age: age of the patient (years)
- anaemia: decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (boolean)
- high blood pressure: if the patient has hypertension (boolean)
- creatinine phosphokinase (CPK): level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L)
- diabetes: if the patient has diabetes (boolean)
- ejection fraction: percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage)
- platelets: platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL)
- sex: woman or man (binary)
- serum creatinine: level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL)
- serum sodium: level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L)
- smoking: if the patient smokes or not (boolean)
- time: follow-up period (days)
- [target] death event: if the patient deceased during the follow-up period (boolean)
